This baseline build on well-established iVector/PLDA speaker verification framework for SRE 2010 female tasks. This work is based on Kaldi SRE 2008 example. The result is reported as the clean iVector/PLDA baseline in [1] with average EER 3.50% over nine core conditions.


To run this experiment plese first check data, hardware and software [requirements](doc/help_sre2010.md) and then read this [guide to repeat experment](SRE2010/README.md).
