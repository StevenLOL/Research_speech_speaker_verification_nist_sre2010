This script distributes data onto different file systems by making symbolic
links. It is supposed to use together with utils/create_split_dir.pl, which
creates a "storage" directory that links to different file systems.

If a sub-directory egs/storage does not exist, it does nothing. If it exists,
then it selects pseudo-randomly a number from those available in egs/storage/*
creates a link such as

  egs/egs.3.4.ark -> storage/4/egs.3.4.ark

Usage: utils/create_data_link.pl <data-archive>
 e.g.: utils/create_data_link.pl nnet5b/egs/egs.3.4.ark
