BOSARIS toolkit version 1.0
---------------------------

This file gives a brief description of how to get started with
using the BOSARIS toolkit.  For more information, see the User Manual
in the docs directory and the User Guide at

https://sites.google.com/site/bosaristoolkit/home/bosaristoolkit_userguide.pdf

Note: you need to have Matlab version R2008a or later to run the code.

You first need to download the toolkit (which presumably you have done if
you are reading this file) from

https://sites.google.com/site/bosaristoolkit/

Download and uncompress either the .zip version or the .tgz version of
the bosaris_toolkit.  If you are running Windows, you probably want to
download the .zip version.

To use the code in Matlab, add the following line to your scripts, or
enter it at the Matlab prompt:

addpath(genpath(path_to_bosaris_toolkit))

Start by running the script "demo_main.m" in the "demo" directory to
see that everything is working.  You can get an idea of some of the
uses of the toolkit by looking at the demo code.  Remember to add the
bosaris toolkit to your path before running the demo.
